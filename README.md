# MySQL-python-db

I created this MySQL database to explore MySQL and the MySQL Connector. The following instructions assume that you have already installed Python3, MySQL, and MySQL terminal.

After cloning the repository, set up a virtual environment. In the terminal, type, "python3 -m venv env". Do not include my quotation marks unless I say to do so.

Select an interpreter by opening the command palette (shift, command, P), and type "Python: Select Interpreter". Select the venv option. It should start with ".\env".

In the command palette, type, "Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal. This will create a terminal for the virtual environment.

Install flask in your virtual environment with "pip3 install flask".

To run the app, in the terminal, type "python3 -m flask run"
